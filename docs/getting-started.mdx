# Getting Started

Getting set up with face tracking in VRChat doesn't have to be an ordeal.
Follow this guide on the basic steps you need to setup your hardware and softare and start sending face tracking data to VRChat.

## Setup

1. Download [VRCFaceTracking](./vrcft-software/vrcft.mdx)
2. Verify that your hardware is in the supported list below, and follow the link to the corresponding setup instructions for your hardware

| Series | Hardware/Headset                                        |
|--------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| Vive   | [Vive Pro Eye](./hardware/VIVE/vpe.mdx)                 |
|        | [Vive Facial Tracker](./hardware/VIVE/face-tracker.mdx) |
|        | [Vive Focus 3](./intro.mdx)                             |
| Meta   | [Quest Pro](./hardware/quest-pro.mdx)                   |
| Apple  | [iPhone](./hardware/iphone-arkit.mdx)                   |

3. Enable OSC In VRChat
4. Swap into a **VRCFT Compatible Avatar**
<!-- apparently this part still isn't clear to some people -->
:::info Avatar Compatibility
At this time, VRChat does **not** have a native face tracking solution.
Avatars must have been specifically [set up](#avatar-setup) for face tracking to work with VRCFaceTracking.
You can learn more about [how the system works](./intro.mdx) if this is confusing.

## Avatar Setup

If you have a working hardware and software setup, or only want to get started with setting up *avatars* for using with VRCFaceTracking, you should follow [Avatar Getting Started](./intro.mdx)
