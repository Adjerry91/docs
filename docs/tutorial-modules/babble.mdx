# VRCFT-Babble (Project Babble Face Tracking)

## Summary

The VRCFT-Babble module facilitates the uses of [Project Babble](https://github.com/SummerSigh/ProjectBabble) face tracking on Windows PCs.

## Set-up

Setup of the Varjo Module is fairly simple, though can be a little confusing depending on your hardware/software configuration. Please read carefully to avoid any issues. 

:::note
This guide assumes you have all of the necessary and relevant Project Babble files installed prior to using the VRCFTVarjoModule. 
This is either the latest build, or the source itself for the project.

### Installation

To use the VRCFTVarjoModule, you will need a compatible headset and the Varjo Base installed.
You can get a copy of the Varjo Base from Varjo's website, you will need an account to download it. 

### Hardware

The VRCFTVarjoModule is compatible with the following hardware:

| Headset | Eye Tracking | Facial Tracking |
| ---------------------------------- | -------- | --------- |
| Varjo Aero                         | `✅` Yes | `❌` No  |
| Varjo XR-3*                        | `✅` Yes | `❌` No  |
| Varjo VR-3*						 | `✅` Yes | `❌` No  |

*Untested

## Using The Varjo Module

To use your Varjo with VRChat, you will need to use one of two modules with the VRCFaceTracking software:

- [M3ga's](https://github.com/m3gagluk/VRCFTVarjoModule) is considered to be the more "stable" option, but only has binary blinking (eyes are fully open and closed)
- [Chickenbread's](https://github.com/Chickenbreadlp/VRCFTVarjoModule) is a experimental fork of M3ga's module. It supports variable eye openness available in newer Varjo SDK versions

For more information on modules and how to use them, see [Modules](./modules.mdx).

:::warning
You MUST unblock the VRCFTVarjoModule.dll file after downloading it. This can be done by right-clicking the VRCFTVarjoModule.dll file, selecting "Properties", and then selecting the "Unblock" button.
If you do not see this option, you do not need to worry about this step.

<div style={{
    width: '50%',
    height: 'auto',
    margin: 'auto',
    display: 'block'
}}>
    <img src={require("./img/varjo/varjo_unblock_instructions.png").default} alt="varjo unblock instructions" />
</div>

Assuming there are no connection issues with the hardware, the connection hardware components should be initialized by VRCFT after a few seconds.

### Calibrating Eye Tracking

Eye tracking is calibrated automatically when you put on the headset, as a quick 1-point calibration.
Additionally, you can perform a 5-point calibration from the leftmost tab in the Varjo Base.
<div style={{
    width: '50%',
    height: 'auto',
    margin: 'auto',
    display: 'block'
}}>
    <img src={require("./img/varjo/varjo_unblock_instructions.png").default} alt="varjo unblock instructions" />
</div>
Eye tracking calibration is not required to be performed frequently, but should be done after the initial Varjo Base software installation, after a change to the headset (i.e. change the facial interface), or when switching the headset between users.

Start calibration by making sure "Allow eye tracking" is enabled in the System tab, then hit the "Calibrate eye tracking" button in the app. Follow the in-app instructions to finish calibrating the eye gaze tracking.  

## Uninstalling The VRCFTVarjoModule
