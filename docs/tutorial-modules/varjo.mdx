## Using The Varjo Module

To use your Varjo with VRChat, you will need to use the [The Varjo VRCFT Module](https://github.com/m3gagluk/VRCFTVarjoModule) with the VRCFaceTracking software.
For more information on modules and how to use them, see [Modules](./modules.mdx).

:::warning
You MUST unblock the VRCFTVarjoModule.dll file before using it. This can be done by right-clicking the VRCFTVarjoModule.dll file, selecting "Properties", and then selecting the "Unblock" button.
If you do not see this option, you do not need to worry about this step.

<div style={{
    width: '50%',
    height: 'auto',
    margin: 'auto',
    display: 'block'
}}>
    <img src={require("./img/varjo/varjo_unblock_instructions.png").default} alt="varjo unblock instructions" />
</div>

Assuming there are no connection issues with the hardware, the connection hardware components should be initialized by VRCFT after a few seconds.

### Calibrating Eye Tracking

Eye tracking is calibrated automatically when you put on the headset, as a quick 1-point calibration.
Additionally, you can perform a 5-point calibration from the leftmost tab in the Varjo Base.
<div style={{
    width: '50%',
    height: 'auto',
    margin: 'auto',
    display: 'block'
}}>
    <img src={require("./img/varjo/varjo_unblock_instructions.png").default} alt="varjo unblock instructions" />
</div>
Eye tracking calibration is not required to be performed frequently, but should be done after initial The Varjo Base software installation, after a change to the headset (i.e. change the facial interface), or when switching the headset between users.

Start calibration by making sure "Allow eye tracking" is enabled in the System tab, then hitting the "Calibrate eye tracking" button in the app. Follow the in-app instructions to finish calibrating the eye gaze tracking.  

## Uninstalling The VRCFTVarjoModule
