## Summary

The VRCFTPimaxModule contains the runtime used to interface with Pimax eye tracking hardware and software on Windows PCs.

:::note
This guide assumes you have PiTool and ASeeVR installed and updated prior to using the VRCFTPimaxModule. 
If you do not have the [PiTool](https://pimaxcom.myshopify.com/pages/pitool-download) and/or [ASeeVR](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ELDtOnMa-MkgchmWFf7w5an-iPOFtQL8/view?ref=Nebo&_ga=2.157958394.1121053981.1651257342-354291550.1593067405)

### Installation

To use the VRCFTPimaxModule, you will need a compatible headset and the PiTool and ASeeVR installed.
You can get a copy of the PiTool and ASeeVR from Pimax's website.

:::warning
The current version of ASeeVR is bugged and must be updated before using it. This can be done by using Guppy's [Pimax Eye Tracking Fix](https://github.com/guppyexpress/Pimax-Eye-Tracking-Fix). Instructions on how to use the fix can be found when you open this link.

For more information on modules and how to use them, see [Modules](./modules.mdx).

Assuming there are no connection issues with the hardware, the connection hardware components should be initialized by VRCFT after a few seconds.
