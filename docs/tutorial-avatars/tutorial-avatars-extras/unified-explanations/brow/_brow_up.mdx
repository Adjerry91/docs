**Brow Up** comes in two distinct shapes for the left and right side of the face
that affect the expression of an avatar:

* Brow Outer Up
* Brow Inner Up

### Brow Outer Up

Brow Outer Up is an expression that relates to how much the 
center of the eyebrow/s and forehead is being raised. Is is based 
on the [frontal belly of the occipitofrontalis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occipitofrontalis_muscle)
's complex muscle movement that constricts the outer parts of the muscle, creating this expression.

This expression is antagonized by the 'Brow Lowerer' expression group, and can modify the shape of 'Brow Lowerer' 
to produce a more angrier expression.
