**Brow Down** comes in two distinct shapes for the left and right side 
of the face that affect the expression of an avatar:

* Brow Pinch
* Brow Lowerer

### Brow Pinch

Brow Pinch is an expression that represents how much the eyebrows 
are pinching together. It is based on the constriction of the 
[corrugator supercilii muscle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corrugator_supercilii_muscle).

This expression visually causes the centers of the eyebrow/s to fold the skin 
over each other, creating a crease wrinkle.

### Brow Lowerer

Brow Pinch is an expression that represents how much the eyebrows 
are pinching together. It is based on general action of the 
[corrugator supercilii](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depressor_supercilii_muscle), 
[procerus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procerus_muscle), and the 
[the upper orbicularis oculi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbicularis_oculi_muscle) muscles.

This expression visually causes the eyebrow/s to lower mostly vertically evenly across the brows.
The direct antagonist of this muscle is the 'Brow Up' expression group, as each sub-expression from 
Brow Up can modify the shape of this to produce a worried or angry expression.

Brow Pinch is a direct complement of this expression, and most interfaces often produce the 
'Brow Down' directly.
