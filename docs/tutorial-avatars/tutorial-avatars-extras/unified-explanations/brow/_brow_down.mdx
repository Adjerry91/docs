### Brow Pinch

### Anatomy

Brow Pinch is an expression that represents how much the eyebrows 
are pinching together. It is based on the constriction of the 
[corrugator supercilii muscle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corrugator_supercilii_muscle).

### Description

Brow Pinch visibly brings the eyebrows closer together, almost pinching them. 
This expression visually causes the centers of the eyebrow/s to fold the skin 
over each other, creating a crease wrinkle. This expression generally associated with angry or 
stressed emotions.

Brow Pinch is a direct complement to Brow Lowerer.

### Brow Lowerer

### Anatomy

Brow Pinch is an expression that represents how much the eyebrows 
are pinching together. It is based on general action of the 
[corrugator supercilii](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depressor_supercilii_muscle), 
[procerus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procerus_muscle), and the 
[the upper orbicularis oculi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbicularis_oculi_muscle) muscles.

### Description

Brow Lowerer visually causes the eyebrow/s to lower mostly vertically evenly across the brows.
This expression generally associated with angry, stressed, or worried emotions.

The direct antagonist of this muscle is the 'Brow Up' expression group, as each sub-expression from 
Brow Up can modify the shape of this to produce a worried or more exaggerated angry expression.

Brow Pinch is a direct complement of this expression, and most interfaces often produce the 
'Brow Down' directly.
