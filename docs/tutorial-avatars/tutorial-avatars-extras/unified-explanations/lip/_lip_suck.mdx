**Lip Suck** is part of 
the <ContextModal comp={LipContext}><b>Lip</b></ContextModal> 
shape group. 

**Lip Suck** refers to these different shapes for the left and 
right face sides respectively:

* LipSuckUpper
* LipSuckLower
* LipSuckCorner

**Lip Suck** is a shape that relies on the 
context of **Jaw Open**, **Jaw Open**, **Mouth Upper Up**, and 
**Mouth Lower Down**. The shape gets modified for 
each of these shapes.
