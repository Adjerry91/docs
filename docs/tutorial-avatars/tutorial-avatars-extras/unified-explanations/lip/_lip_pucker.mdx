### Anatomy

Lip Pucker is based on the complex 
[orbicularis oris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbicularis_oris_muscle)'s 
action of pushing out the lips whilst staying together.

**Lip Pucker** is part of 
the <ContextModal src={require('./_lip_general.mdx').default}><b>Lip</b></ContextModal> 
shape group. 

### Description

Lip Pucker is an expression that pushes forward the lips whilst staying together. 

Unified Expressions splits this shape up into four (4) distinct shapes:

* LipPuckerUpperRight
* LipPuckerUpperLeft
* LipPuckerLowerRight
* LipPuckerLowerLeft

This allows interfaces and shapes to adopt more intricate shapes of the lips.
