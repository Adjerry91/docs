### Anatomy

Lip Funnel is based on the complex 
[orbicularis oris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbicularis_oris_muscle)'s 
action of pushing and rolling the lips into a funnel shape.

**Lip Funnel** is part of 
the <ContextModal src={require('./_lip_general.mdx').default}><b>Lip</b></ContextModal> 
shape group. 

### Description

Lip Funnel is an expression that pushes and rolls the lips into a funnel like shape. 

Unified Expressions splits this shape up into four (4) distinct shapes:

* LipFunnelUpperRight
* LipFunnelUpperLeft
* LipFunnelLowerRight
* LipFunnelLowerLeft

This allows interfaces and shapes to adopt more intricate shapes of the lips.
