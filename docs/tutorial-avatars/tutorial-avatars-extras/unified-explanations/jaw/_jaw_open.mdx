### Anatomy

Jaw Open is based on the the [masseter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masseter_muscle) and 
[temporalis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/temporalis_muscle)'s 
general action of shifting the jaw sideways.

### Description

Jaw Open lowers the jawbone drastically. This expression maxes out 
when the jaw muscles are fully extended.

When the jaw bone opens, the lips will slightly stretch inwards towards the 
mouth cavity, causing the lips to roll over the teeth slightly and obscure them. 
This causes the upper lip to visibly stretch downwards very slightly, and the lower 
lip to visibly be pulled upwards slightly when Jaw Open is fully active.
