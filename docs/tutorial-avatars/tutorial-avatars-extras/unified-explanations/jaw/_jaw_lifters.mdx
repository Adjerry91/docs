**Jaw Lift** refers the shapes that represent how the 
jaw can be lifted:

* Jaw Mandible Raise
* Jaw Clench

### Jaw Mandible Raise

***

### Anatomy

Jaw Mandile Raise is an expression based on the raising action of the 
[masseter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masseter_muscle) and 
[temporalis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temporalis_muscle) muscle grouping.

This expression would happen if there is ***no*** physical restrictions of the 
mouth preventing this shape happening (such as having no teeth).

### Description

Jaw Mandible Raise raises the jawbone past the point of a standard neutral 
jaw position. The neutral position of the jaw usually is the natural or 
*just* closed position of the jaw.

This expression is a direct antagonist to 'Jaw Open', as they are based on 
opposing actions of the same muscle structure.

### Jaw Clench

***

### Anatomy

Jaw Clench is an expression based on the raising action of the 
[masseter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masseter_muscle) and 
[temporalis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temporalis_muscle) muscle grouping.

This expression would happen if there ***is*** a physical restrictions of the 
mouth preventing this shape happening (such as having teeth).

### Description

Jaw Clench causes the sides of the jaw to visibly flex when enacted. 
This shape is active any time there is any build-up of stress with the 
jaw muscles.

This expression is a direct antagonist to 'Jaw Open', as they are based on 
opposing actions of the same muscle structure.

### JawMandibleRaise v.s. JawClench

While both of these expressions are based on the same fundamental muscle 
structure, the use case is more specific to how an interface might implement 
these, and how avatars will *react* to these shapes being driven.

If your avatar does not have any natural physical obstructions inside the mouth 
(such as teeth, tongue, etc), then creating a JawMandibleRaise shape would be applicable. 
This would gate whether an interface is or is not able to raise the lower jawbone *past the 
point of having the jaw just be closed*.

Jaw Clench on the other hand represents how *much* the jaw muscles are stressing beyond the 
point of the jaw being closed. This can be reliant on both 'Jaw Open' and 'Jaw Mandible Raise'. 
This will cause the jaw muscles on the sides of the face to visibly flex, indicating that these 
muscles are being constricted but ultimately not moving the jawbone upwards.
