### Anatomy

Mouth Closed is based on the complex 
[orbicularis oris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbicularis_oris_muscle)'s 
action of pushing and rolling the lips into a funnel shape.

**Mouth Closed** is part of the 
<ContextModal src={require('./lip/_lip_general.mdx').default}><b>Lip</b></ContextModal> 
shape group. 

### Description

Mouth Closed is an expression that closes the lips as the 
jaw bone opens. This keeps the appearance that the mouth is closed, 
usually to contain something within the mouth or even to create 
more complex emotions

This expression is usually associated with surprise, astonishment,
sadness, or confusion emotions.

### Mouth Ape Shape 

This shape is a direct inverse of 'Mouth Ape Shape', which is a combination 
of both Jaw Open and Mouth Closed. This shape is produced by the 
SRanipal shape standard. This means that if an avatar uses Mouth Ape Shape, 
the animation can be adjusted to work with Unified Expressions with
no downside.
