### Nasal Dilation

**Nasal Dilation** is tied to 2 distinct shapes for each eye in 
**Unified Expressions**: 

* Nasal Dilation
* Nasal Constrict

These shapes represent the *offset* from the 
default **Nasal Dilation** on an avatar. Generally it is a good 
idea to have the avatar use the average nose diameter as the 
basis, and use these the two shapes to modify the basis as such.
