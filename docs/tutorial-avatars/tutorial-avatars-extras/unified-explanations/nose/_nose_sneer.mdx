### Anatomy

Nose Sneer is based on the 
[levator labii superioris alaeque nasi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levator_labii_superioris_alaeque_nasi_muscle) 
muscle's ability to lift the upper lip, 
scrunch the nose, and slightly pull the 
inner eyebrow downward.

### Description

Nose Sneer is an expression that scrunches up 
the face by slightly lifting up the upper lip, 
pulling up the nose, scrunching the nose bridge, 
and pulling down the inner eyebrow slightly.

### Relationship to Mouth Upper Up

Nose Sneer is complementary to Mouth Upper Up by 
making the upper lip raise more extremely.

Nose Sneer can also rely on Mouth Upper Up to know when to reveal 
the teeth (as in, while Mouth Upper Up is not active, 
keep the lower lips attached to the upper lips when using 
Nose Sneer).
