**Mouth Raiser** is part of 
the <ContextModal comp={MouthContext}><b>Mouth</b></ContextModal> 
shape group.

The following shapes build up the overall **Mouth Raiser**:

* MouthRaiserUpper
* MouthRaiserLower

The Upper shape is a "corrective" shape that allows the mouth to 
stay closed when **MouthRaiserLower** happens. When **MouthRaiserUpper** is 
not in use, the **MouthRaiserLower** shape contextually *overlays* when this 
happens.
