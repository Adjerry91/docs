### Relationship to Mouth Tightener

This shape has similarities to **Mouth Tightener**, but has a entirely distinct function and shape. 
The shape that **Mouth Tightener** represents is the overall lips scrunching together, both horizontally 
and somewhat vertically. This is distinct from *Mouth Press*, which only presses the lips together 
vertically exclusively.

### Relationship to Lip Suck
