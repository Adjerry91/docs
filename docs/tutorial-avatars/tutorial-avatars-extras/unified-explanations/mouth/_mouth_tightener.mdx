This explanation is still being worked on. 
Information may change in the future.

:::

***

**Mouth Tightener** is part of 
the <ContextModal comp={LipContext}><b>Lip</b></ContextModal> 
shape group.

:::info Mouth Tightener is not part of the Mouth group

Although this expression is labelled as **Mouth** in the name, the anatomical basis 
of Mouth Tightener is not based on the other **Mouth** shapes, but falls under **Lip** for this 
reason.

:::

This shape has similarities to **Mouth Press**, but has a entirely distinct function and shape. 
The shape that **Mouth Tightener** represents is the overall lips scrunching together, both horizontally 
and somewhat vertically. This is disctinct from *Mouth Press*, which only presses the lips together 
vertically exclusively and rolls the surrounding mouth in a little bit, similarly to **Lip Suck**.
