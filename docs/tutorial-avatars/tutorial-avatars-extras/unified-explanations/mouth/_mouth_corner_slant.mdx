**Lip Corner Slant** is part of 
the <ContextModal comp={MouthContext}><b>Mouth</b></ContextModal> 
shape group and part of the **Smile** expressions sub-group.

:::info Lip Corner Slant is not part of the Lips group

Although this expression is labelled as Lip in the name, the anatomical basis 
of Lip Corner Slant is not based on the other Lip shapes, but falls under Mouth for this 
reason.
