Cheek Squint is an expression that is based on the 
[lower, outer part of the orbicularis oculi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbicularis_oculi_muscle) 
and partially influenced by the 'Smile' expression group.

This means that this expression can partially affect 
how the eyelid is shaped as well, causing a very mild 
squint affect similar to 'Eye Squint', though 'Eye Squint' 
is a lot more direct and complementary to 'Eye Blink'.

The expression visibly raises and bulges the cheeks on the upper 
part of the face, causing them to jut out slightly as well. This 
expression is complementary to the 'Smile' shape group, and can help 
in expressing a happy or excited expression.
