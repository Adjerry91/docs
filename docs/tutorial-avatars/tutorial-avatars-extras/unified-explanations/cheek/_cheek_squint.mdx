### Anatomy

Cheek Squint is an expression that is based on the 
[lower, outer part of the orbicularis oculi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbicularis_oculi_muscle) 
and partially influenced by the 'Smile' expression group.

### Description

Cheek Squint visibly raises and bulges the cheeks on the upper 
part of the face, causing them to jut out slightly as well.

### Relationship to Eye Squint 

Cheek Squint is a complement to 'Eye Squint', as the 
shape is based on the same underlying muscle group.

This means that this expression can partially affect 
how the eyelid is shaped as well, causing a very mild 
squint affect similar to 'Eye Squint', though 'Eye Squint' 
is a lot more direct and complementary to 'Eye Blink'.
To think of how little the lower eyelid should move,
try to squint your cheek while consciously forcing your 
eyes wide open.
