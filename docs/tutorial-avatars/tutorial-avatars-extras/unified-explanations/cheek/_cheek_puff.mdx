This expression does not have any anatomical reference to a 
facial muscle, and is simple an action created by the context of 
the face containing a differential pressure in the inside of the mouth. 
Cheek Puff in this context represents the mouth containing excess air, 
liquids, or other objects that accentuate the volume of the cheeks.
