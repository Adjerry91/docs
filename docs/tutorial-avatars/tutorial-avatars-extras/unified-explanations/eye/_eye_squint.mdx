### Anatomy

Eye Squint is an expression that is based on the complex 
constricting action of the [palpebral part of orbicularis oculi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbicularis_oculi_muscle)'s 
closing the eyelid.

### Description

Eye Squint is a direct representation of how much the eye lid is 
being stressed by the lower eyelid muscle. This can result in different 
shapes depending on eyelids are closed. This expression also can represent 
different emotions such as suspensefulness or happiness.

This shape is a *direct modifier* of 'Eye Closed', 
and relies on the context of 'Eye Closed'. This means 
that the shape that Eye Squint ends up creating is entirely 
based on the state of 'Eye Closed'.

When 'Eye Closed' is open (or in other words, not active), Eye Squint will raise the lower eyelid 
until it meets the eye's pupil. This makes it look like a character is squinting their lower eyelid in a 
stressing manner.

As 'Eye Closed' closes (in-between active and inactive), Eye Squint is adjusted to slowly blend 
between stressing the lower eyelid, and positioning the eyelid to be centered on the center of the eyeball.

When 'Eye Closed' is closed (is active), Eye Squint is adjusted to 
position the eyelid to be centered on the center of the eyeball, and 
*stressing* the eye muscles around the eyelid. Although the *stressing* action can 
be achieved with just Eye Squint, other shapes such as Brow Down, Cheek Squint, and 
Nose Sneer can help with achieving a desired stress-squinting action.
