### Anatomy

Eye Squint is an expression that is based on the complex 
constricting action of the [palpebral part of orbicularis oculi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbicularis_oculi_muscle)'s 
closing the eyelid.

### Description

This shape is a direct modifier of 'Eye Closed', 
and relies on the context of 'Eye Closed'.

When 'Eye Closed' is open (or in other words, not active), Eye Squint will raise the lower eyelid 
until it meets the eye's pupil. This makes it look like a character is squinting their lower eyelid in a 
stressing manner.

As 'Eye Closed' closes (in-between active and inactive), Eye Squint is adjusted to slowly blend 
between stressing the lower eyelid, and positioning the eyelid to be centered on the center of the eyeball.

When 'Eye Closed' is closed (is active), Eye Squint is adjusted to 
position the eyelid to be centered on the center of the eyeball, and 
*stressing* the eye muscles around the eyelid. Although the *stressing* action can 
be achieved with just Eye Squint, other shapes such as Brow Down, Cheek Squint, and 
Nose Sneer can help with achieving a desired stress-squinting action.
