### Anatomy

Although the Eye Dilators are based on two distinct shapes, they 
ultimately visually represent the constriction and retraction of the 
[iris dilator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_dilator_muscle) muscle/s.

### Description

**Pupil Dilation** is tied to 2 distinct shapes for each eye in 
**Unified Expressions**: 

* EyeDilation
* EyeConstrict

These shapes represent the *offset* from the 
default Eye Dilation on an avatar. Generally it is a good 
idea to have the avatar use the average pupil diameter as the 
basis and use these the two shapes to modify the basis as such.
