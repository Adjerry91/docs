### Anatomy

Eye Closed is an expression that is directly based on the complex constricting action of the 
[palpebral part of orbicularis oculi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbicularis_oculi_muscle)'s 
closing the eyelid, and based on the 
[levator palpebrae superioris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levator_palpebrae_superioris_muscle) 
being in a neutral position (when the eyelids are open).

### Description

Eye Closed represents the eyelids being closed, specifically in the state of a full blink; 
The shape of the eyelid will be visibly in a 'lowered' shape, with the upper eyelid fully 
lowered to the lower eyelid. 

:::info *Eye Closed* is a foundational shape. 

Shapes such as *Eye Squint* and *Eye Widen* rely on the 
context of *Eye Closed* in order to properly be represented 
as shapes. These other shapes can be refered to as *modifier* 
shapes of *Eye Closed*.

### Relationship to Eye Squint

Eye Closed is also helped by 'Eye Squint', a modifier shape that helps position the eyelid 
even further by shifting the lower eyelid when Eye Closed is fully open, and helps 
position the eyelid to be in a raised state by modifying the Eye Closed shape when it 
is fully closed.

:::info Eye Closed is an objective measurement of how open your eyelid is

Eye Closed will always measure the Openness of your eyelids; Eye Squint *can not* 
represent it fully. Openness is a measurement of how visible the eye's pupil is, and 
anatomically represents your eyelid's natural resting position. Eye Squint is reliant 
on Eye Closed to determine how much the eye should squint. 

Please refer to to the 'Eye Squint' shape for better clarity on how that is achieved.

:::

Though in this context, if you don't use 'Eye Squint' at all, you can simply bake 
the squinting action into your Eye Closed shape to simplify the shape even further 
(though it is recommended to use Eye Squint to help modify)

### Relationship to Eye Wide

Eye Closed is a direct antagonist of Eye Wide, this means that the muscle or action of 
Eye Closed is directly opposite of Eye Wide.
