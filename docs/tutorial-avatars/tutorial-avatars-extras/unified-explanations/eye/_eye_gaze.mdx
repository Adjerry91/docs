### Anatomy

Eye Gaze is based on the generalized [extraocular](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraocular_muscles) 
group of muscles that represents the cardinal directions that the eye is capable of looking in.

### Description

Eye Gaze is a generalized way to represent where the eyeballs are. 
This can be represented as a combined or converged gaze of the eye. 
Generally each eye can produce a distinct direction gaze and thus 
each eye shape cardinal direction is modelled in Unified Expressions.

In **Unified Expressions**, there are two components to **Eye Gaze**: `absolute` and `expression`.
Movement of the eyeball itself would be referred to as `absolute` gaze, whereas the movement 
of the face "flesh" around the eyes as the eyes look around would be referred to as the gaze `expression`. 

Avatars typically use an armature with the eyes attached 
to an Eye bone and/or blendshapes to create the overall Eye Gaze.

:::info Absolute and Expression

The shapes for Eye Gaze usually should only include the `expression` component. 
`Absolute` eye gaze is most typically handled with bone transformation and is *not* part of the blendshape
in most avatars, though this is by no means a requirement in implementation.

### Direction Shapes

In Unified Expressions, Left and Right Eye Gaze `expressions`
direction listed in this way: 

`Up`, `Down`, `Out`, and `In`. 

This definition of the direction is very specific and helps 
contextualize the left and right eye shapes.

This makes it very clear how the shapes function, as `Out` refers to the shape 
moving away from the center of the face, while `In` refers to the shape moving towards 
the center of the face. `Up` and `Down` are already contextually relative to your face 
as your face is vertically asymetric.
