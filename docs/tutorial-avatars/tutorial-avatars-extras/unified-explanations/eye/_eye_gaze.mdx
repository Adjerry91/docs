### Generalizations

In **Unified Expressions**, **Eye Gaze** comes in 
two subtypes: `absolute` and `expression`.

Avatars typically use an armature with the eyes attached 
to an Eye bone and/or blendshapes to create the overall Eye Gaze.

:::info Absolute vs Expression

When using an armature bone, the direct nature of bone transformation 
is an `absolute` Eye Gaze. Using blendshapes is described as an `expression` 
as several generalized blendshapes are used to modify the Eye 
Gaze apparent shape even further.

### Shape Explanations

In Unified Expressions, Left and Right Eye Gaze `expressions`
direction listed in this way: 

`Up`, `Down`, `Out`, and `In`. 

This definition of the direction is very specific and helps 
contextualize the left and right eye shapes.

This makes it very clear how the shapes function, as `Out` refers to the shape 
moving away from the center of the face, while `In` refers to the shape moving towards 
the center of the face. `Up` and `Down` are already contextually relative to your face 
as your face is vertically assymetric.
