### Eye Widen

Eye Widen is an expression that is directly associated with the constriction of the
[levator palpebrae superioris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levator_palpebrae_superioris_muscle) 
muscle. This will cause the eyelid to visibly widen and also lift up the 
[orbicularis oculi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbicularis_oculi_muscle) very slightly.

This expression is directly antagonized by Eye Closed, and represents the eyes going into a widened state.
