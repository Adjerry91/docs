### Anatomy

Eye Widen is an expression that is directly associated with the constriction of the
[levator palpebrae superioris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levator_palpebrae_superioris_muscle) 
muscle. This will cause the eyelid to visibly widen and also lift up the 
[orbicularis oculi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbicularis_oculi_muscle) very slightly.

### Description

Eye Widen represents how wide the eyelid is opened beyond the eyelid's relaxed position. This 
expression generally represents alertness, surprise, and other related emotions.

This expression is directly antagonized by Eye Closed, and represents the eyes going into a widened state.
