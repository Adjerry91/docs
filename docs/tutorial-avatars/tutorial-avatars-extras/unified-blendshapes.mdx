### Summary

**Unified Expressions** is an open source face expression standard used as 
the tracking standard for VRCFaceTracking and the expression shape standard 
for avatars. It is fully compatible with existing face tracking shapes from other 
expression standards such as `ARKit` / `PerfectSync`, `SRanipal`, `FACS`, and others. 

This document contains information about Unified Expressions, including 
the overall usage of it and references for shapes to use on avatars.

## Why use Unified Expressions? {#ue-why}

***

### Unified Expressions is a high fidelity and adaptable standard.

**Unified Expressions** is a robust face expression standard that avatars can use to 
create face tracking shapes, and gives avatar creators a huge amount of choice in how 
they want to best adapt tracking behaviors to their avatars.

### Unified Expressions is designed to unify all shape and tracking standards.

VRCFaceTracking uses Unified Expressions as the bridge between tracking interfaces and 
avatar shapes. This allows for a huge amount of tracking customization, specialization, and backwards 
compatibility for many existing VRCFaceTracking avatars.

It is able to use shapes designed for other tracking standards and provide tracking transformations 
to work with different shape standards such as `ARKit`, `FACS`, `SRanipal`, and others.

Building an avatar for Unified Expressions also means that you will only have to build a 
single set of shapes for an avatar that will work nearly identically across different face 
tracking devices and interfaces. Unified Expressions shapes are untied to any device 
or interface implementation; the shapes are instead wholely reliant on anatomical basis to give 
grounding to the shapes.

### Unified Expressions is formatted to be able to be improved over time.

The Unified Expressions standard is also formatted in a heirarchy of fidelity, powered 
by VRCFaceTracking's dynamic parameter system, allowing avatars to adopt either more *simplistic* 
or more *complex* tracking behaviors out of the expression shapes. Unified Expressions was 
built out this way in order to retain backwards compatibility with future revisions and to allow 
the standard to evolve over time (if and when the need for updating arises).


## Unified Expressions Best Practices {#ue-best-practice}

***

**Unified Expressions** is similar to most other facial expression standards available, with the addition of 
many additional transformed expression shapes provided that allow avatars to highly specialize 
or even optimise their face tracking setups to work best with their avatars.

:::info **Unified Expressions** has many *Blended* shapes available for use on avatars that can affect tracking.

Blended shapes can be used to simplify, combine, or alleviate both shape creation and offer more simplified 
tracking behavior on avatars. Creators should familiarize with all available shapes and decide what shapes 
work best on certain avatars.

:::

:::tip Consistency is Key!

While any shape or animation setup on an avatar can be controlled 
using any Unified Expressions shape, correlating to the available 
Unified Expressions shapes will ensure that your avatar 
will track in the best and most consistent way possible.

This means that the expression on the avatar's face should generally 
correlate to the shape that is being tracked. This means that JawOpen 
should open the jaw, or a blended shape like MouthOpen should part open 
the avatar's lips, and so forth.

Any extra expressions outside of the face such as ear movement that could be 
controlled by specific expressions are highly encouraged to give life to 
your avatars!

## Unified Expressions Shapes {#ue-ref}

***

This section contains documentation for all currently implemented **Unified Expressions** 
shapes available for use in **VRCFaceTracking** on avatars. These are all the shapes contained 
under the Unified Expressions shapes umbrella:

* [Base Shapes](#ue-base-shapes), the base anatomical shapes.
* [Blended Shapes](#ue-blended-shapes), which are shapes that blend many Base Shapes into simpler shapes.

:::info These are shape references, not parameters.

For **VRCFaceTracking** specific avatar parameters please refer to Avatar [Parameters](./parameters/parameters.mdx), which 
lists the parameters that are intended to control these shapes.

import ExampleExpl from './unified-explanations/_example_explain.mdx'

:::danger Documentation still actively in development

Information may be sparse, and we are working to incorporate features that 
allow us to give highly detailed explanations in the future.

### Base Shapes {#ue-base-shapes}

The following table contains all base shapes available in Unified Expressions.

:::info Decide what shapes are best for your avatar!

Unified Expressions' Base Shapes are heavily based upon highly 
technical facial anatomies and, while this might be good for achieving 
highly detailed face tracking (and highly recommended), there may be cases 
where you might prefer to use more simplified or easier to create shapes. 
This could be to suit an avatar's style, simplify tracking behavior, or to 
quickly develop shapes that will *just work*.

Many of the following shapes may be able to be discretionally 
mixed and matched together! Please refer to [Blended Shapes](#ue-blended-shapes) for 
officially supported simplified shapes for avatars. Thanks to VRCFaceTracking's 
powerful parameter system, Unified Expressions can be organically adjusted to 
suit your avatar's needs.

Please read through all available shapes and decide what is best for your avatar!

### Blended Shapes {#ue-blended-shapes}

The following shapes blend together the 
Unified Expressions Base Shapes above into more simplified shapes. 
Many of these align with tracking interfaces, other face tracking 
standards, and generalized expressions.

:::info Unified Expressions is designed to be flexible

Many [Base Shapes](#ue-base-shapes) may be able to be discretionally mixed and matched 
together that are not otherwise listed here. The listed shapes 
below also have direct tracking transformations available in 
VRCFaceTracking.
