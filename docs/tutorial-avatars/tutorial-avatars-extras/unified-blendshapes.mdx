### Summary

**Unified Expressions** is an open source face expression standard used as 
the tracking standard for VRCFaceTracking and the expression shape standard 
for avatars. It is fully compatible with existing face tracking shapes from other 
expression standards such as `ARKit` / `PerfectSync`, `SRanipal`, `FACS`, and others. 

This document contains information about **Unified Expressions**, including 
the overall usage of it and references for shapes to use on avatars.

## Why use Unified Expressions? {#ue-why}

***

### Unified Expressions is a high fidelity and adaptable standard.

**Unified Expressions** is a robust face expression standard that avatars can use to 
create face tracking shapes, and gives avatar creators a huge amount of choice in how 
they want to best adapt tracking behaviors to their avatars.

### Unified Expressions is designed to unify all shape and tracking standards.

**VRCFaceTracking** uses **Unified Expressions** as the bridge between tracking interfaces and 
avatar shapes. This allows for a huge amount of tracking customization, specialization, and backwards 
compatibility for many existing VRCFaceTracking avatars.

It is able to use shapes designed for other tracking standards and provide tracking transformations 
to work with different shape standards such as `ARKit`, `FACS`, `SRanipal`, and others.

Building an avatar for **Unified Expressions** also means that you will only have to build a 
single set of shapes for an avatar that will work nearly identically across different face 
tracking devices and interfaces. **Unified Expressions** shapes are untied to any device 
or interface implementation; the shapes instead wholely reliant on anatomical basis to give 
grounding to the shapes.

### Unified Expressions is formatted to be able to be improved over time.

The **Unified Expressions** standard is also formatted in a heirarchy of fidelity, powered 
by **VRCFaceTracking**'s dynamic parameter system, allowing avatars to adopt either more *simplistic* 
or more *complex* tracking behaviors out of the expression shapes. **Unified Expressions** was 
built out this way in order to retain backwards compatibility with future revisions and to allow 
the standard to evolve over time (if and when the need for updating arises).


## Unified Expressions Best Practices {#ue-best-practice}

***

**Unified Expressions** is similar to most other facial expression standards available, with the addition of 
many additional transformed expression shapes provided that allow avatars to highly specialize 
or even optimise their face tracking setups to work best with their avatars.

:::info **Unified Expressions** has many *Blended* shapes available for use on avatars that can affect tracking.

Blended shapes can be used to simplify, combine, or alleviate both shape creation and offer more simplified 
tracking behavior on avatars. Creators should familiarize with all available shapes and decide what shapes 
work best on certain avatars.

:::

:::tip Consistency is Key!

While any shape or animation setup on an avatar can be controlled 
using any Unified Expressions shape, correlating to the available 
Unified Expressions shapes will ensure that your avatar 
will track in the best and most consistent way possible.

This means that the expression on the avatar's face should generally 
correlate to the shape that is being tracked. This means that JawOpen 
should open the jaw, or a blended shape like MouthOpen should part open 
the avatar's lips, and so forth.

Any extra expressions outside of the face such as ear movement that could be 
controlled by specific expressions are highly encouraged to give life to 
your avatars!

## Unified Expressions Shapes {#ue-ref}

***

This sections contains documentation for all currently implemented **Unified Expressions** 
shapes available for use in **VRCFaceTracking** on avatars.


### Unified Expressions Base Shapes {#ue-base-shapes}

The following tables contain all base shapes that are used on avatars and as the basis of **VRCFaceTracking**'s 
avatar parameters.

:::info These are shape references, not parameters.

For **VRCFaceTracking** specific avatar parameters please refer to Avatar [Parameters](./parameters/parameters.mdx), which 
lists the parameters that are intended to control these shapes.

import ExampleExpl from './unified-explanations/_example_explain.mdx'

:::danger Documentation still actively in development

Information may be sparse, and we are working to incorporate features that 
allow us to give highly detailed explanations in the future.

### Unified Expressions Blended Shapes {#ue-blended-shapes}

***

The following shapes are intended to simplify and blend together the 
Unified Expressions Base Shapes above. Creating shapes for these 
Blended shapes instead can be used to simplify shape creation, optimise 
avatars for specific face tracking setups, or allow an avatar to exhibit 
certain tracking behaviors.

The following shapes also are categorized by what their general 
expression functionality is based on.

:::info Unified Expressions is designed to be flexible

Many shapes may be able to be discretionally mixed and matched 
together that are not otherwise listed here. The listed shapes 
below also have direct tracking transformations available in 
VRCFaceTracking. Many shapes can make up a Blended shape listed 
here.
