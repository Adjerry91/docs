# Basic Avatar Setup

## *Setup* Setup

The first step to setting up your avatar with face tracking is to make sure that your face tracking works!

Make sure that you have followed [Getting Started](../../intro/getting-started.mdx) and have a working hardware and software setup before getting down to working on your own avatars. 
By doing this, you make your life when debugging your avatar *much* easier
