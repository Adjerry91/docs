## Introduction

The Pico 4 Pro / Enterprise is a standalone VR headset powered by the Qualcomm XR2, similar to the Quest 2 and Quest Pro headsets from Meta.
Unlike the "consumer" version of the Pico 4, the Pro and Enterprise versions of the headset have additional eye and face tracking cameras, in addition to a few more hardware upgrades. 
The Pro and Enterprise editions only differ in the available system software and region availablity: the Pro only being sold in mainland China, while the Enterprise is sold in Europe with "limited" enterprise software.

## Setup

:::tip
Both the Pro and Enterprise can use the updated PC streaming app "Pico Streaming Assistant" to stream eye and face tracking data from the headset. 
:::

:::warning
The facetracking compatible Streaming Assistant program is currently still in "beta" and only avaliable from Pico's Chinese beta group.
:::

1. Install the beta Streaming Assistant

## Module

Install the "Pico4SAFTExtTrackingModule" from the [VRCFaceTracking Module Registry](../vrcft-software/vrcft.mdx#module-registry).

[Pico4SAFTExtTrackingModule source repository](https://github.com/regzo2/PicoStreamingAssistantFTUDP/tree/vrcfacetracking-module)

### Startup Instructions

1. Start PCVR using the Pico Streaming Assistant 
2. Once connected and in SteamVR, start VRCFaceTracking with the Pico4SAFTExtTrackingModule initialized

:::warning
The Pico 4 Pro/Enterprise module will currently (erroneously) always initialize, and will fail to shutdown its own update thread when tearing down modules (closing VRCFaceTracking).
You may need to shut down VRCFaceTracking manually.
