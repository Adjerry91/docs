# Quest Pro

The Meta Quest Pro provides eye gaze tracking, detailed eye expression tracking, and face tracking.
All eye and face tracking hardware is internal to the device (no additional hardware setup required).
All eye and face tracking data is accessed via Meta’s Face and Eye OpenXR extensions.

Document being remade for new module system, some links will not work.
:::

## Why is this setup required?

The Quest Pro provides developers with both eye and face tracking data from a single, contained device, making it easy for native Quest developers to incorporate.
However, having it only accessible through Meta’s Oculus OpenXR extensions means there must be an OpenXR application using the Oculus runtime running somewhere.
There is currently no way for VRCFT to provide eye and face tracking to the Quest version of VRChat, the following solutions are only for PCVR.
Note that native Eye Tracking support is now in open beta for the Quest version of VRChat for use with the Quest Pro.

## Modules

There are two different modules for streaming out face tracking data into VRCFT.
If you are using the ALXR program for streaming PCVR to the headset, you *must* use Korejan's ALXR module.
Otherwise if using Oculus Link/Airlink, either module should work.

1. [Korejan's ALXR Module](../intro.mdx)
2. [TofuLemon's OpenXR Module](../intro.mdx)

Follow the module installation instructions in the respective module pages, and learn about the avalible PCVR streaming methods by continuing down to [Setup](#setup)!

## Setup

The Quest Pro currently has 2 different face-tracking compatible ways to connect to the PC:

- Oculus Link (or Airlink)
- ALVR

The user is free to choose whatever method they prefer more. ALVR is an open-source project and thus has many for features and customizability in the PCVR connection as compared to Airlink, but also has more bugs or quirks.
Oculus Link/Airlink is Meta’s own PCVR streaming solution, and is generally more straight-forward to set up and network stable, but also is limited in customization.

In both cases the user is expected to have the VR PC and the Quest Pro on the same network, with the PC ideally connected to the network via ethernet cable.

### Enabling Developer Mode on the Headset

Instructions originally from https://learn.adafruit.com/sideloading-on-oculus-quest/enable-developer-mode

1. [Set up a Meta Oculus developer account](https://developer.oculus.com/sign-up/)
    * A developer account is necessary (for now) as the eye and face OpenXR extensions are currently considered "developer features".
   It is rather trivial to apply for and there is no check for being a "real organization".
2. Install the Oculus ("Meta Quest") app on mobile device (if it isn’t already) and login with your (developer) Oculus account. Register your headset in the app.
3. In the Oculus mobile App, tap Menu at the bottom right, then Devices. Select your Quest Pro, then go to `Settings -> Developer Mode` and set the Developer Mode switch to enabled.
    * Reboot the headset after enabling Developer Mode.

### Enabling Eye and Face Tracking on the Headset

1. Open up the Settings in your Quest Pro headset, and navigate to "Movement Settings"
2. Select the "Natural Facial Expressions" tab on the left, then Enable Natural Facial Expressions
3. Select the "Eye Tracking" tab on the left, then Enable Eye Tracking. If you haven’t already, calibrate your eye tracking

### Oculus Link/Airlink PC Setup

:::info
The video tutorials from Ninka are for an older version of VRCFaceTracking.
While many of the headset setup will be the same, note that VRCFaceTracking specific steps will be different.
:::

1. [**Set your headset to developer mode using the Oculus mobile app**](#enabling-developer-mode-on-the-headset)
:::warning
Do **not** skip this step. Please follow the instructions for setting the headset to developer mode using the mobile app before proceeding. 
Even if you think it is in developer mode already, **follow the instructions anyways**.
:::
2. [Enable Headset Eye and Face Tracking](#enabling-eye-and-face-tracking-on-the-headset)
3. Install and start the [Oculus PC application](https://www.oculus.com/download_app/?id=1582076955407037) (if it isn't already).
4. Follow setup instructions for logging in and adding your Quest Pro to `Devices`.
5. In the Oculus PC application, click on `Settings` in the left sidebar, then `General` tab. Turn on `Unknown Sources`. Set the `OpenXR Runtime` to Oculus
:::warning
**SET THE OPENXR RUNTIME TO OCULUS**. This is the second most forgotten step of Quest Pro setup.
:::
![Oculus PC App General Tab](img/quest/oculus_pc_app_general.png)
6. Navigate to the `Beta` tab. Enable `Developer Runtime Features`, `Eye tracking over Oculus Link`, and `Natural Facial Expressions over Oculus Link`.
You can try enabling `Passthrough over Oculus Link` but that *may* cause issues. 
:::note
If you do not see these options, you did not follow the previous steps correctly.

### Startup Procedure for Oculus Link/Airlink

Once your desired module has been added to VRCFaceTracking:

1. Launch (Air)Link on the Quest Pro. Make sure you are in the Oculus Home environment before proceding.
2. Launch VRCFaceTracking.
3. Launch SteamVR **from the PC**

### ALVR/ALXR Setup

1. Install SideQuest (Advanced Installer) on your computer. https://sidequestvr.com/setup-howto
   - The SideQuest application will have a built-in tutorial for the following steps.
2. **Set your headset to developer mode using the Oculus mobile app**. :ref:`enable developer mode`
:::warning
Do **not** skip this step. Please follow the instructions for setting the headset to developer mode using the mobile app before proceeding. 
Even if you think it is in developer mode already, **follow the instructions anyways**. 
:::
3. [Enable Headset Eye and Face Tracking](#enabling-eye-and-face-tracking-on-the-headset)
4. Connect your Quest Pro headset to your computer with a *data-transfer* USB cable.
Once connected you will be prompted to "Allow USB debugging" and "Allow File Access". Make sure to allow both.
(You should also check the *Always allow from this computer* box to prevent the message from popping up again later)
Your headset should now be ready to be used with SideQuest.
5. Download the [latest ALXR **Quest** Client (`alxr-client-quest.apk`)](https://github.com/korejan/ALXR-experimental/releases/)
6. Use SideQuest to install `alxr-client-quest.apk` to your Quest Pro. Click the *"Install APK file from folder"* button, then select the downloaded `alxr-client-quest.apk` in the file prompt.
![How to install APKs in SideQuest](img/quest/hacks_sidequest-install-other-crop2.png)
7. Download [ALVR Server v18.2.3 (`alvr_server_windows.zip`)](https://github.com/alvr-org/ALVR/releases/tag/v18.2.3)
   - Optionally, you can try [this custom build of alvr_server v18 from korejan](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1aA1j4H97mSKebjS_puCd4-FUKnxZMBfC/view?usp=share_link) that includes the encoding changes found in alvr v19
    :::note
    Newer versions of ALVR server are incompatible with ALXR client, so only use the linked options here (for now!)
    :::
8. Unzip ``alvr_server_windows.zip`` somewhere convenient, then launch ``ALVR Launcher.exe``. Follow the initial setup procedure in the launched ALVR Server app.
9. Once the ALVR Server is up and running, launch the ``alxr_client`` app that you installed earlier on your Quest Pro.
In your Apps Library, you will need to set the category of shown apps to "Unknown Sources" to see the installed ``alxr_client``.
![Unknown Sources](img/quest/quest_pro_unknown_sources.png)
10. With ALXR client running on the headset, go back to the ALVR Server PC application and make sure you're on the "Connections" tab.
There should now be a Meta Quest Pro in the "New Clients" list, with a "Trust" button on the right side of its entry.
Click "Trust" to allow the ALVR server app to make the connection to the ALXR client app on the Quest Pro.
Back in the headset, SteamVR should now be streamed from the PC to the headset.
![After Trusting the Quest Pro in ALVR](img/quest/alvr_connection.png)

#### If you are planning on using a USB cable instead of Wi-Fi streaming for the ALXR/ALVR connection

1. Follow the [Official ALVR Community Instructions](https://github.com/alvr-org/ALVR/wiki/Using-ALVR-through-a-USB-connection) for setting up the USB connection.
2. Change the text in the `questProIP` file to `127.0.0.1`

### Startup Procedure for ALVR/ALXR

1. Launch the ALVR server application on the PC and the alxr_client application in the Quest Pro headset.
2. Launch VRCFaceTracking.exe and make sure to load the ALXR module for the Quest Pro

### Using Index Controllers with the Quest Pro with Link/Airlink

Download these [Powershell Scripts (Discord Link)](https://discord.com/channels/849300336128032789/1033745772979699775/1056009844701806643)

To run, right-click the file -> `"Run with Powershell"`

### Using Index Controllers with the Quest Pro with ALVR/ALXR

The customizability of ALVR allows a few options in this regard. All following mentioned settings can be found in the "Headset" tab of the ALVR settings.

- Option 1: Completely disable the Quest Pro controllers using the checkbox next to "Controllers"
- Option 2: Set the Controller emulation to "HTC Vive Tracker". This allows real controllers such as the Index Controllers to take precedence in SteamVR, and allow
  for using the Quest Pro controllers for manual playspace calibration.


## Common Issues (and How to Solve Them)

<!-- TODO: turn these into a table.. -->

- **When using Oculus Link/Airlink, I cannot see SteamVR because it is blocked by ALXR's green screen or Oculus home says it is still running "VRCFaceTracking"**
  - Cause: The nature of the way VRCFaceTracking must pull data from the Oculus OpenXR runtime is inherently hacky, effectively running 2 VR programs at once.
  - Solution: Try starting SteamVR *after* starting VRCFaceTracking through the desktop Steam app (not through the Oculus Dash in the headset).
               An alternative solution is to use [OculusKiller](https://github.com/LibreQuest/OculusKiller) to avoid dealing with the Oculus Dash entirely.

- **ALXR/ALVR methods: "[ERROR] No connection could be made because the target machine actively refused it"**
  - Cause: The ALXR VRCFT server is not running.
  - Solution: Usually the problem is related to [missing a step](#oculus-linkairlink-setup)
     and the ALXR log may make it clear as to what step exactly was forgotten.

- **OpenXR VRCFT module method: "[QuestOpenXR] Failed to GetFaceExpressionWeightsFB"**
  - Cause: There is some permission in the setup that was not set correctly.
  - Solution: *Carefully* re-run through [the setup](#oculus-linkairlink-setup), paying careful attention to all the steps before the method split.

- **"I 100% made sure I followed all setup correctly, and I'm *not getting any visible errors anywhere*, but VRC only receives 0 values for all parameters (and VRC loaded a non-zero number of parameters from config)"**
  - Solution: Try toggling the eye and face tracking enables in the headset settings.

- **Oculus Link/Airlink: My playspace calibration resets if I take off the headset.**
  - Cause: When the Quest headset enters sleep mode after detecting you have taken off the headset, it loses it's original reference space to which the SteamVR space was calibrated to.
  - Solution: Download the [Meta Quest Developer Hub](https://developer.oculus.com/documentation/unity/ts-odh/) and follow the instructions for *Connect Headset to MQDH* and *Disable proximity sensor and guardian*.
     This will prevent the headset from entering sleep, but does mean your headset stays fully active even if you take it off.
