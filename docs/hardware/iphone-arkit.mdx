# iPhone ARKit Tracking

:::note

An iPhone with a TrueDepth camera or A12 Bionic Chip can send ARKit Face Tracking (“PerfectSync”) data to VRCFT for use in VRChat. 
Due to the nature of how Apple’s ARKit Face Tracking works, this method of face tracking is intended only for desktop mode, as the iPhone cannot track only the bottom of your face while you are wearing a VR headset.
