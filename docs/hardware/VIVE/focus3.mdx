## Introduction

The Vive Focus 3 is a standalone VR headset powered by the Qualcomm XR2, similar to the Quest 2 and Quest Pro headsets from Meta.
Although by default having neither eye nor face tracking, the Focus 3 has 2 add-on modules that can be installed to add eye and face tracking capabilities.

## Setup

1. Install the eye and/or face tracking modules to the headset. Both modules should come with their own hardware quick-start guides in the box and should generally simply involve a single USB-C port in a nearby location on the headset.
