# Project Babble - HP Reverb G2 Omnicept Setup Guide

## Summary

The [HP Reverb G2 Omnicept Edition](https://www.hp.com/us-en/vr/reverb-g2-vr-headset-omnicept-edition.html) is a VR headset with eye tracking and a lower face camera. While there is a module that allows you to use the headset's eye tracking with VRCFaceTracking, the face camera by itself does not do anything.

</div>

***But!*** With Project Babble this camera can be used to track your facial expressions! This guide will show you how to use the lower face camera with VRCFaceTracking.

## Setup

You will need the following software installed to use the lower face camera with VRCFaceTracking:
- The [VRCFT-Babble Module](./babble-setup)
- [OBS](https://obsproject.com/download)
- [Project Babble](https://github.com/SummerSigh/ProjectBabble/releases/latest)
- The [Glia Runtime/SDK](https://developers.hp.com/omnicept/downloads)
- The [Glia Lip Viewer](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/915075185328152606/1122604181728006244/GliaLipViewer.zip)

### Installation

#### Step 1: Glia Lip Viewer Setup

Firstly, extract the contents of the `GliaLipViewer.zip` file to a folder of your choice. You can delete the zip file after this is done.

<div style={{
    width: '50%',
    height: 'auto',
    margin: 'auto',
    display: 'block'
}}>
    <img src={require("../img/babble/babble_unzipped.png").default} alt="The Glia Lip Viewer, extracted to a folder" />
</div>

Next, run `Glia.exe` inside of this new folder. If your HP Reverb G2 Omnicept Edition is plugged in, you should see a small window with a live feed from the lower face camera, tinted red. Otherwise, you'll see a solid red box. If this is the case make sure your headset is plugged in and that you have the Glia Runtime installed.

:::note
You may get a warning from the Glia Runtime about an application requesting access to the lower face camera. If you do, make sure to click "Allow".
:::

#### Step 2: OBS Setup

Open OBS and add a new "Window Capture".

<div style={{
    width: '50%',
    height: 'auto',
    margin: 'auto',
    display: 'block'
}}>
    <img src={require("../img/babble/obs_window_creation.png").default} alt="Creating the OBS Window Capture" />
</div>

Select the Glia window from the list of windows...

<div style={{
    width: '50%',
    height: 'auto',
    margin: 'auto',
    display: 'block'
}}>
    <img src={require("../img/babble/obs_glia_capture.png").default} alt="Selecting the GliaLipViewer window" />
</div>

Now resize OBS to fit the size of the window. This can be done by right clicking on the "Window Capture" source and selecting ""Resize output (source size)".

<div style={{
    width: '50%',
    height: 'auto',
    margin: 'auto',
    display: 'block'
}}>
    <img src={require("../img/babble/obs_window_resize.png").default} alt="Resizing the OBS Window" />
</div>

Next, click on the filters tab...

<div style={{
    width: '50%',
    height: 'auto',
    margin: 'auto',
    display: 'block'
}}>
    <img src={require("../img/babble/obs_window_filter.png").default} alt="OBS Window Capture filter" />
</div>

Add a "Color Correction" filter.

<div style={{
    width: '50%',
    height: 'auto',
    margin: 'auto',
    display: 'block'
}}>
    <img src={require("../img/babble/obs_filter_color_correction.png").default} alt="OBS Window Color Correction" />
</div>

Increase the brightness of the video by adjusting "Gamma", you want to make this about ~3 times as bright as it is by default. You can also adjust the contrast and saturation to your liking.

<div style={{
    width: '50%',
    height: 'auto',
    margin: 'auto',
    display: 'block'
}}>
    <img src={require("../img/babble/obs_filter_gamma.png").default} alt="OBS Window Color Correction Gamma" />
</div>

:::info
This may seem like a strange step, but the HP Reverb G2 only outputs a [greyscale image](https://developers.hp.com/omnicept/docs/unity/usage-examples) from the lower face camera. This step is necessary to make the image usable: Project Babble expects a color image, so this step compensates for the lack of green and blue.
:::

Finally, start a virtual camera and have Project Babble target this new device. 

<div style={{
    width: '50%',
    height: 'auto',
    margin: 'auto',
    display: 'block'
}}>
    <img src={require("../img/babble/obs_virtual_camera.png").default} alt="OBS Virtual Camera" />
</div>

:::caution
In its present state, you will need to launch the `GliaLipViewer` and OBS's virtual camera every time you want to use this with Project Babble/VRCFaceTracking.
:::

You should now be able to see your lower facial expressions reflected in VRCFaceTracking! Have fun!
