An Android phone (or realistically any Android-running device with a camera) can generate ARKit-*like* face tracking data for VRCFT using the MeowFace app. 
Due to the nature of how the app works, this method of face tracking is intended only for desktop mode, as the app cannot track only the bottom of your face while you are wearing a VR headset.
