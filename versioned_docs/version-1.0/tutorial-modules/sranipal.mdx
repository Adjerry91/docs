# SRanipal (VIVE)

## Set-up
Setup of the SRanipal Module is fairly simple though can be a little confusing depending on your hardware/software configuration.
Please read carefully to avoid any issues.

### Software
To use the SRanipal Module, you'll need a compatible headset and the [SRanipal Runtime](https://google.com/sranipal-sdk) installed.
The installer is known to be a little buggy at times, so if you're having issues, make sure to completely uninstall the runtime and delete the `C:\Program Files\VIVE\SRanipal` folder (if it exists), then try again.
:::info
The SRanipal Runtime is only compatible with Windows.
If you're having performance issues and are using the Vive Pro Eye and/or the Vive Facial Tracker, try downgrading to SRanipal version 1.3.1.1
