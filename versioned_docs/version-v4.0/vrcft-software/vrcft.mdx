# VRCFaceTracking Program

import {EditUrl, CustomLink} from '@site/src/components/Utils.tsx'

export const TextColor = ({children, color}) => (
    <span
        style={{
            color: color,
        }}>
    {children}
  </span>
);

VRChat has no native implementation of Vive' SRanipal software needed to interface with the Facial Tracker nor Vive Pro Eye, or any other face tracking hardware, 
which means there must be an intermediary software accessing the face tracking data and sending it to VRC via OSC.
VRCFaceTracking fulfills this role as the intermediary, creating a standard face-tracking parameter set for use with VRChat avatars.

## Using VRCFaceTracking

To be able to use VRCFT, OSC must be enabled in VRChat.
VRCFaceTracking will automatically set OSC to "Enabled" if it detects that it was not already, but you can (and should) also enable it manually to avoid having to restart the game for the automatic switch to take effect.

Changing the OSC IP and Ports

Use ``--osc=[output port]:[ip address]:[input port]`` launch argument.

For example: ``--osc=9000:127.0.0.1:9100`` is the common option when using VRCFaceTracking with [VRChatOSCRouter](../intro.mdx)

To set this permanently, create a shortcut to the VRCFaceTracking program, right-click the newly-created shortcut and open "Properties", and add the line to the shortcut "Target". 
Make sure to maintain a space between the flags and what was in the box already, and keep the flags outside of the quotation marks of the file path if they exist.

## VRCFaceTracking "Housekeeping"

There are occasionally small things good to be aware of when using face tracking with VRCFT and VRChat.

### Unblocking Downloaded Dynamic Link Libraries (.dlls)

1. Right-click on the .dll file, open "Properties"
2. Down at the bottom of the Properties window check the checkbox option for 'Security' to "Unblock".

:::note
   If you don't see a checkbox to "Unblock", then it was not blocked automatically by Windows and you can safely continue.

### Resetting VRChat OSC Configs

Because of the sheer number of possible face tracking parameter configurations, VRCFaceTracking does not blindly send OSC messages for every possible parameter.
Until VRChat releases the ["OSC Query" update](https://ask.vrchat.com/t/developer-update-2-september-2022/13470#oscquery-9), which is [currently in closed beta](https://github.com/vrchat-community/osc/issues/143#issuecomment-1304419543),
VRCFaceTracking will rely on the static OSC config .json generated for each avatar to know what parameters to send.
This configuration file is **never** updated automatically, it must be reset manually to force VRC to generate an up-to-date version or manually edited yourself.

There are two ways of resetting the configs:

1. Using the OSC Radial Menu (In-game)

   1. While in VRC, open the Radial Menu.
   2. Navigate to Options -> OSC 
   3. Make sure that "Enabled" is set to True (white bar on the right side). Setting this will cause an avatar refresh. 

2. Deleting the config .json files

   1. Navigate to your AppData folder. You can get to ``AppData\Roaming`` by typing ``%appdata%`` into the search bar in the Windows Start Menu, or in the address bar of any Explorer window.
   2. Go to ``..\AppData\LocalLow\VRChat\VRChat\`` and delete the OSC folder.
   3. Restart VRC or refresh your avatar (by resetting or swapping avatar)

## Common Problems and How to Solve Them

- **VRCFaceTracking isn't starting at all**
  - Cause: VRCFaceTracking is likely trying to access a module library (.dll) that is blocked by Windows Security.
  - Solution: [unblocking downloaded dynamic link libraries](#unblocking-downloaded-dynamic-link-libraries-dlls)

- **VRCFaceTracking is crashing when I join a world / change avatars**
  - Cause: VRCFaceTracking failed to parse an invalid avatar OSC config.
  - Solution: Clear out your VRChat Avatar OSC folder. Follow option 2 in [resetting OSC config](#resetting-vrchat-osc-configs)

- **My personally uploaded Avatar loads 0 parameters!**
  - Cause: Your avatar either doesn't have face tracking parameters, or is using an old OSC config that didn't have the face tracking parameters.
  - Solution: Follow option 1 and/or 2 in [resetting OSC config](#resetting-vrchat-osc-configs). If completely clearing the OSC configs still results in loading 0 parameters, the avatar does not use VRCFT-compatible parameters.
