# Tracking Module SDK

***

:::danger v4.0.0 SDK will be depricated soon!

The documentation here references VRCFaceTracking in the `v4.0.0` 
release state. If you want to see the latest documentation that 
is reflective of active development, please consider using the 
['Current' docs](docs/vrcft-sdk/tracking-module.mdx)

:::

### Summary

**VRCFaceTracking** provides an external tracking module 
SDK that allows developers to send face tracking data to 
any **VRCFaceTracking** compatible app. Modules will send 
data to the **UnifiedTrackingData** interface that 
VRCFaceTracking will use to send tracking data to applications.

### Tracking Module Overview {#ue-overview}

* [Project Setup](#project-setup)
* [Tracking Module Architecture](#tracking-module-architecture)
* [Building Project](#building-project)

## Project Setup

***

**VRCFaceTracking** uses **.NET Framework**, a relatively 
easy and intuitive development platform. **VRCFaceTracking** has 
the ability to load any class library (Managed `.dll` files) built 
on the **.NET Framework** platform using a built-in module loader.

To get started, create a new Class Library project using the 
**.NET Framework v4.7.2** SDK and framework. Many IDEs provide a template to 
quickly get started with this environment.

:::tip

Name the project after the tracking interface being implemented to 
VRCFaceTracking; a general naming scheme for tracking modules is along 
the lines of `ExampleExtTrackingInterface`.

:::

Once the project environment is setup, include `VRCFaceTracking` 
as a dependency (this can either be a project reference by using the 
VRCFaceTracking project in your own project, or by referencing the 
`VRCFaceTracking` binary), and inherit `ExtTrackingModule` to your 
module's main class. This will be where all the main functionality 
of the module will be implemented.

:::warning Must implement ExtTrackingModule

VRCFaceTracking will at this time only load your external module 
if the base class inherits ExtTrackingModule, otherwise it will be
skipped. This is to ensure that developers are implementing a 
tracking interface extension for devices to use VRCFaceTracking tracking 
data, or otherwise.

This may be changed in the future to allow different types of modules 
to be loaded by the module loader (potentially those that can provide 
an output for VRCFaceTracking tracking data, modify parts of VRCFaceTracking, 
modify the UI of VRCFaceTracking, and more).

:::

The default architecture platform should be `Any CPU` or `x86` to build 
for VRCFaceTracking.

Your project environment should be fully setup and ready to accept your 
tracking interface!

## Tracking Module Architecture

***

:::tip Refer to the VRCFaceTracking API!

The following API's are referenced when 
writing a module. These are included with `VRCFaceTracking`. 

* [`ExtTrackingModule`](https://github.com/benaclejames/VRCFaceTracking/blob/v4.0.0/VRCFaceTracking/SDK/ExtTrackingModule.cs)
* [`UnifiedTrackingData`](https://github.com/benaclejames/VRCFaceTracking/blob/v4.0.0/VRCFaceTracking/UnifiedTrackingData.cs)
* [`ViveSR.anipal.Lip`](https://github.com/benaclejames/VRCFaceTracking/blob/v4.0.0/VRCFaceTracking/TrackingLibs/SRanipal/Lip/SRanipal_LipData_v2.cs#L11)
* [`ViveSR.anipal.Eye`](https://github.com/benaclejames/VRCFaceTracking/blob/v4.0.0/VRCFaceTracking/TrackingLibs/SRanipal/Lip/SRanipal_EyeData_v2.cs)

[**VRCFaceTracking v4.0.0 source code**](https://github.com/benaclejames/VRCFaceTracking/tree/v4.0.0).

:::

```c title="ExampleExtTrackingInterface.cs"
public class ExampleExtTrackingModule : ExtTrackingModule
{
    // What your interface is able to send as tracking data.
    public override (bool SupportsEye, bool SupportsLip) Supported => (true, true);

    // This is the first function ran by VRCFaceTracking. Make sure to completely initialize 
    // your tracking interface or the data to be accepted by VRCFaceTracking here. This will let 
    // VRCFaceTracking know what data is available to be sent from your tracking interface at initialization.
    public override (bool eyeSuccess, bool lipSuccess) Initialize(bool eyeAvailable, bool lipAvailable)
    {
        var state = (eyeAvailable, lipAvailable);

        //... Initializing module. Modify state tuple as needed (or use bool contexts to determine what should be initialized).

        return state;
    }

    // Function that should poll data from the tracking interface.
    public override Action GetUpdateThreadFunc()
    {
        return () =>
        {
            while (true)
            {
                /*
                Get latest tracking data from your interface and transform to VRCFaceTracking data.

                UnifiedTrackingData.EyeTrackingData.Left.Openness = ExampleTracker.LeftEye.Openness;
                UnifiedTrackingData.LipTrackingData.LatestShapes[(int)LipShape_v2.JawOpen] = ExampleTracker.Mouth.JawOpen;

                Feel free to function out different parts of your code to keep this function readable.
                */
            }
        };
    }

    // Called when the module is unloaded or VRCFaceTracking itself tears down.
    public override void Teardown()
    {
        //... Deinitialize tracking interface; dispose any data created with the module.
    }
}
```

## Building Project

Once the tracking module is fully setup, you are able to make a binary that can then 
be loaded by VRCFaceTracking's module system! With `VRCFaceTracking` as a 
dependency, you can make a build of you module for use in VRCFaceTracking.

Simply take the compiled binary and place it in `%appdata%\VRCFaceTracking\CustomLibs`, 
VRCFaceTracking will load external modules after attempting to load the integrated SRanipal 
Tracking Module.

:::tip Use Build Events!

Setting up build events for your project can make it easy to 
iterate your project faster. Create a build event to place your 
compiled binaries into the appropriate destinations!
