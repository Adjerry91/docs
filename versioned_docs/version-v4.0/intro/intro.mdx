:::danger Still In Development

A complete overhaul to VRCFaceTracking is *coming soon*, bringing big advancements to the parameters, modules, adding tracking data processing, and more.
Be aware that the "current" version of the docs (what you see right now) is written for the *upcoming* version.
Change to the "v4.0" docs version for pages more specific to the old VRCFT.
