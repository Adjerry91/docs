:::info Joining the Discord is highly recommended

The Discord is the best place to get help with VRCFT, and to stay up to date with the latest news and announcements.
There might be a couple of links places throughout the documentation that will require you to be a member of the Discord to access.

**Please Remember**<br/>
This is a community driven project created by the community and provided for **free**.
Please don't join the Discord **expecting** to get help, and consider helping others out when you can.

A good place to start would be <EditUrl>by editing these docs</EditUrl> or even contributing to the project itself!
